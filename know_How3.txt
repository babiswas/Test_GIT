A class method is a class which is not bound to the object of the class but bound to the class.
Class variable is shared by all the instances.


class C(object):
   @staticmethod
   def fun(arg1,arg2,...):

class D(object):
   @classmethod
   def fun(cls,arg1,arg2,..):

classmethod,staticmethod.

A staticmethod is also bound to the class and not the object of the class.
